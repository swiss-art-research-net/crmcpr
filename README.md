## CRM Creative Process Representation Repository Description ##

This repository exists to provide a point of access for users to download the stable releases of the Creative Process Representation (CRMcpr).

This repository is maintained through a collaboration between:

- the Swiss Art Research Infrastructure (https://www.sari.uzh.ch/en.html)
- Takin.solutions (https://takin.solutions)

CRMcpr is an extension of the CIDOC CRM standard (https://www.cidoc-crm.org) and FRBRoo (https://cidoc-crm.org/frbroo/) designed to support the representation of creative processes in their historical evolution through different phases with different products (informational and physical) down to, potentially, the manifest artistic object. It introduces the key concepts of oeuvre and modelling of programming, design, and planing phases of a creative process in order to support the representation of the provenance and eventual origins of artistic objects in a flow of creative acts. For details of this modelling pattern and strategy please refer to the specification and surrounding documentation.

The CRMcpr extension is developed and maintained using the OntoMe tool. The project space for CRMcpr can be found here:

https://ontome.net/project/30

Changes to the ontology are managed through that tool. Official releases, as of version 1.5, are created systematically through the (semi) automatic generation of specification and rdfs files from OntoMe.

Discussions, suggestions and queries relative to the ontology should be raised using the issues feature of this repository.

In this repository users will find the different stable versions of CRMcpr which can be used for creating, managing and querying semantic data using the CIDOC CRM, FRBRoo and the CRMcpr ontologies. Each release includes at least a specification document in pdf format, explaining the ontology, and an rdfs file which enables its implementation as a semantic web ontology in rdfs supporting platforms and systems.

This is version 1.5.1

Please note a technical update was made to the RDF to improve its compatibility. When adopting the RDF in the serialization folder, please make use of the CRM_CPR_1.5.1.1.rdf file which contains the most correct serialization.
